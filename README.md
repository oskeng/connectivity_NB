# connectivity_NB
Python scripts for conducting a density analysis for HCV forest and preparing input to Omniscape (and post-processing the output) for simulation of structural connectivity in Norrbotten county, Sweden

Main scripts are standalone but requires a GRASS GIS installation. Some scripts currently need to be run from within GRASS GIS.
